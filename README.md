# JS Signer

This is a Javascript open source project that demonstrates how to add 
signatures to API calls using the Flickr REST API authentication scheme.

Any API (proprietary or public) can use this library to sign calls if the 
authentication scheme is basically the same.  (It is a common authentication 
scheme for API application or user authentication).
